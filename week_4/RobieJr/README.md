## üìπ Behavior

Robie Jr. moves forward, and when it detects an object within ~15 cm, it:
1. Stops
2. Reverses
3. Scans both directions with servo
4. Turns toward the clearer path
5. Continues forward

The LCD displays Robie's status like "Moving Forward" or "Turning Left", and the LED eye lights up while driving forward.
